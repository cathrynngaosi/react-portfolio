          <p className="about-intro">
            The idea of creating something from nothing has always been exciting
            to me, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here ‚òÄÔ∏è
          </p>
          <p>
            A bachelor‚Äôs degree in Information Technology and my years of
            experience in the industry have enabled me to hone my skills in web
            development, UI/UX design, and everything in between. Being able to
            create beautiful websites has always been a goal of mine, and I‚Äôm
            determined to grow and enhance my skills further.

            and trying new places to eat as an avid foodie When I&apos;m not
            glued to my laptop, you can find me in cafes, crafting with my
            Cricut, and exploring new places to eat as an avid foodie. I love
            exploring new places whenever I have the chance to travel, attending
            live concerts, and making countless memories with my family (üê∂
            counted!) and friends.
