          the idea of creating something from nothing has always been exciting

          <p>
            I am an experienced developer with a track record of creating
            beautiful and functional user experiences. My journey in the
            industry, coupled with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Information
            Technology, has enabled me to refine my skills in web development,
            UI/UX design, and more. Crafting beautiful websites has always been
            a personal goal, and I‚Äôm dedicated to further enhancing my skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I‚Äôm not glued to my laptop, you can find me in cafes, crafting,
            or exploring new places to eat as an avid foodie. I love exploring
            new places whenever I have the chance to travel, attending live
            concerts, and making countless memories with my family (üê∂ counted!)
            and friends.
